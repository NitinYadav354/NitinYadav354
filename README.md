# Hey there! I'm Nitin Yadav 👋 

A software enthusiast who believes code is like pizza - better when shared! 🍕  

## About Me  
- Studying **Software Engineering** at DTU.  
- Juggling **AI**, **DSA**, and **backend development** like a pro - just don’t ask me to juggle in real life!  

## When I'm Not Coding  
- Brainstorming ideas for my next hackathon project.  

## My Goal  
I like building things that actually solve problems (or at least make life a little less boring).

## Let’s Connect!  
Always down to collaborate, brainstorm, or debug (yours, not my typos 😅).
Let’s make something worth pushing to main.
